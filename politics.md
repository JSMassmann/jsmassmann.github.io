In case anybody is curious, here I vent my political opinions. Don't argue with me if I don't know you; we both have better things to do.

DRM is theft: a computer, being affordable by anyone, should not take away your rights. The only thing Intel SGX is good for is stopping a rootkit from spying on you.

AI will have a terrible impact on jobs and creativity in the future, and for the time being it's not good enough to function as just an assistant: it's a dichotomy.

People who think LGBTQ+ people are degenerates or should be forced to conform, etc. are simply ignorant. Same goes for transmedicalism.

I do not trust any major world governments, especially the NSA and GCHQ. Where does the $100 million budget go? I don't believe they actually stopped after 2013.
