# Hiii!

I'm a trans girl. My interests include:

- Maths, particularly computability theory, computational complexity theory, alpha-recursion theory, set theory, model theory and proof theory.
- Programming. I know Python, JavaScript, C++, C# and Go. I have also dabbled in ASM.
- All other sciences, but I don't know them at such a high level as I do maths and CS.
- The great video game Celeste.
- Listening to music. I have extremely eclectic tastes.

# Other somewhat extraneous facts

My pronouns are she/her - but feel free to use they/them or neopronouns. As you could guess, Iâ€™m a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

I live in the UK and speak English fluently, and I used to speak German natively. My Myers-Briggs personality type is INTP-T.

# Academia-related

Here's where I'll put a repository of all my papers, slides, etc. related to my formal academic pursuit of mathematics.

## My research papers

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## My preprints and notes

I have so far published 1 preprint. I shall keep a repository of all my papers, as well as their LaTeX source code, on this website. I'm quite pedantic and consistent in spacing, etc. in LaTeX.

- "Extending the Veblen Function" w/ A. Kwon
  - [PDF](papers/DimVeb/Dimensional_Veblen.pdf)
  - [TEX](papers/DimVeb/main.tex)
  - [BIB](papers/DimVeb/main.bib)

I have not published any sets of notes regarding courses or particular topics.

## In preparation

I'm preparing a couple of research articles and preprints. Of course, I won't upload their PDF or TEX here, for reasons related to privacy and plagiarism, but I might as well make a list of their titles.

- "Notes on Martin's Conjecture"
- "A Simple Approach to Admissible Proof Theory"
- "A Beginner's Introduction to Set Theory"
- "Quasiprojective Determinacy, the I0 Axiom and the Ultrapower Axiom"
- "A note on pseudo-ill-founded ordinal points"
- "Global theories of ordinals, stable ordinals and hyperuniversality"
- "The inverse collapse iteration hypotheses and p.f-bad conjecture"
- "Fundamental sequences up to omega-one of chess
- "The paradigm of collapsification and natural ordinal representations beyond $$\Pi^1_1 \textrm{-CA+BI}$$"
- "Maximal projection functions below the least uncountable cardinal"
- "Elementary variants of large cardinals and reducibility"
- "Fine structure of recursive functional hierarchies"
- "Expressive Complexity Theory and $$< \omega$$-Completeness Frameworks"

## My talks

I have not yet been invited to present any talks.

I have prepared slides, in the event I do ever present talks, regarding some papers. They may be easier to understand than those papers, which is one of the main reasons I'm uploading them here.

- "Ordinal Notations up to $$\eta_0$$", describing results of "Extending the Veblen Function".
  - [PDF](slides/DimVeb/Slides.pdf)
  - [Shortened PDF](slides/DimVeb/Slides%20(1).pdf)
  - [TEX](slides/DimVeb/main.tex)

Once again, all slides shall be uploaded. I also uploaded shortened versions, which omit pauses.

## My books

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## My manuscripts and monographs

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## Service activities

Maybe there'll be something here one day.
