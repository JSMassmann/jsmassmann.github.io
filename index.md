# Hiii!

I'm a trans girl. My interests include:

- Maths, particularly computability theory, computational complexity theory, alpha-recursion theory, set theory, model theory and proof theory.
- Programming. I know Python, JavaScript, C++, C# and Go. I have also dabbled in ASM.
- All other sciences, but I don't know them at such a high level as I do maths and CS.
- The great video game Celeste.
- Listening to music. I have extremely eclectic tastes.

# Other somewhat extraneous facts

My pronouns are she/her - but feel free to use they/them or neopronouns. As you could guess, Iâ€™m a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

I live in the UK and speak English fluently, and I used to speak German natively. My Myers-Briggs personality type is INTP-T.

# My papers

I have so far published 1 paper. I shall keep a repository of all my papers, as well as their LaTeX source code, on this website. I'm quite pedantic and consistent in spacing, etc. in LaTeX.

- "Extending the Veblen Function" w/ A. Kwon
  - [PDF](papers/DimVeb/Dimensional_Veblen.pdf)
  - [TEX](papers/DimVeb/main.tex)
  - [BIB](papers/DimVeb/main.bib)

# My talks

I have not yet been invited to present any talks.

I have prepared slides, in the event I do ever present talks, regarding some papers. They may be easier to understand.

- "Ordinal Notations up by $\eta_0$", describing results of "Extending the Veblen Function".
  - [PDF](slides/DimVeb/Slides.pdf)
  - [TEX](slides/DimVeb/main.tex)

Once again, all slides shall be uploaded.
