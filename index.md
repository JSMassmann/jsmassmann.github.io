# Hiii!

I'm a trans girl. My interests include:

- Maths, particularly computability theory, computational complexity theory, alpha-recursion theory, set theory, model theory and proof theory.
- Programming. I know Python, JavaScript, C++, C# and Go. I have also dabbled in ASM.
- All other sciences, but I don't know them at such a high level as I do maths and CS.
- The great video game Celeste.
- Listening to music. I have extremely eclectic tastes.

# Other somewhat extraneous facts

My pronouns are she/her - but feel free to use they/them or neopronouns. As you could guess, Iâ€™m a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

I live in the UK and speak English fluently, and I used to speak German natively. My Myers-Briggs personality type is INTP-T.

# Academia-related

Here's where I'll put a repository of all my papers, slides, etc. related to my formal academic pursuit of mathematics.

## My research papers

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## My preprints and notes

I have so far published 2 preprints. I shall keep a repository of all my papers, as well as their LaTeX source code, on this website. I'm quite pedantic and consistent in spacing, etc. in LaTeX.

- "Extending the Veblen Function" w/ A. Kwon
  - [PDF](papers/DimVeb/Dimensional_Veblen.pdf)
  - [TEX](papers/DimVeb/main.tex)
  - [BIB](papers/DimVeb/main.bib)
  - <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseAbstract1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseAbstract1">Abstract</a>

  <div class="collapse" id="collapseAbstract1">

  <div class="card card-body">
    This paper serves to define an extension, which we call dimensional Veblen, of Oswald Veblen's system of ordinal functions below the large Veblen ordinal. This is facilitated by iterating derivatives of ordinal functions along multidimensional array structures, and can be viewed as the "maximal" natural extension of the Veblen functions. We then construct an ordinal notation based on it, and provide a conversion algorithm from Buchholz's function below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal.

- "Recursive Analogues of Shrewdness and Subtlety, with Applications to Fine Structure"

  <div class="collapse" id="collapseAbstract2">

  <div class="card card-body">
    We share both recent and older, well-known results regarding the notions of stable ordinals and shrewd cardinals. We then argue that nonprojectible ordinals may be considered as recursive analogues to subtle cardinals, a highly combinatorial type of cardinal related to Jensen's fine structure, due to the latter possessing a characterisation in terms of shrewdnesss.

I have not published any sets of notes regarding courses or particular topics.

## In preparation

I'm preparing a couple of research articles and preprints. Of course, I won't upload their PDF or TEX here yet, for reasons related to privacy and plagiarism, but I might as well make a list of their titles. For the sake of tidiness, I have sorted them in descending order in terms of how much I have written of them so far.

- "Hod mice, The Ultimate K and the ultrapower axiom"
- "Quasiprojective Determinacy, the I0 Axiom and the Ultrapower Axiom"
- "Polynomial regularities and tassels"
- "A Beginner's Introduction to Set Theory"
- "Fine structure of recursive functional hierarchies"
- "The inverse collapse iteration hypotheses and p.f-bad conjecture"
- "Large Cardinals, Elementary Resemblance and the Rayo-like Hierarchy"
- "Layer-wise interpretation of higher-order arithmetic"
- "The Truth Lattice, Causation and Modal Logic"
- "Notes on Martin's Conjecture"
- "Elementary variants of large cardinals and reducibility"
- "A Simple Approach to Admissible Proof Theory"
- "A Simplified Ordinal Representation System for Kripke-Platek set theory with first-order reflection"
- "A note on pseudo-ill-founded ordinal points"
- "Fundamental sequences up to omega-one of chess, and determinacy-type ordinal notations"
- "The Xi function and higher-order computability"
- "Absolute infinity in the modern context"
- "Structure of implication"
- "Expressive Complexity Theory and $$< \omega$$-Completeness Frameworks"
- "Maximal projection functions below $$\omega_1$$"
- "Global theories of ordinals, stable ordinals and hyperuniversality"
- "The paradigm of collapsification and natural ordinal representations beyond $$\Pi^1_1 \textrm{-CA+BI}$$"

## My talks

I have not yet been invited to present any talks.

I have prepared slides, in the event I do ever present talks, regarding some papers. They may be easier to understand than those papers, which is one of the main reasons I'm uploading them here.

- "Ordinal Notations up to $$\eta_0$$", describing results of "Extending the Veblen Function".
  - [PDF](slides/DimVeb/Slides.pdf)
  - [Shortened PDF](slides/DimVeb/Slides%20(1).pdf)
  - [TEX](slides/DimVeb/main.tex)

Once again, all slides shall be uploaded. I also uploaded shortened versions, which omit pauses.

## My books

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## My manuscripts and monographs

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## Service activities

Maybe there'll be something here one day.
