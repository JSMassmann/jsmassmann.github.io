# Hiii!

I'm a trans girl. I like maths, programming, Celeste, listening to music and cats. I also used to watch anime quite a lot.

# Somewhat extraneous facts

My pronouns are she/her - but feel free to use they/them or neopronouns. As one could guess from that, I’m a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

I live in the UK and speak English fluently, and I used to speak German natively. My Myers-Briggs personality type is INTP-T.

# Maths

My ORCID is 0009-0003-8458-4700.
My Erdős number is `NaN`: the only person who I've collaborated with has only collaborated with me.
I'm the author of OEIS sequence A368423.

Below are some small blogs or expositions I've put on my website:

- [Binary WHILE](blog/BW.md).

## My research interests

I like proof theory, large cardinals, inner model theory, recursion theory and cryptography. For some of these my knowledge isn't as good as it can be, but I'm currently not focusing that much on learning new things.

## My preprints and notes

I have so far published 2 preprints. I shall keep a repository of all my papers, as well as their LaTeX source code, on this website. I'm quite pedantic and consistent in spacing, etc. in LaTeX.

- "Extending the Veblen Function" w/ A. Kwon
  - [PDF](papers/DimVeb/Dimensional_Veblen.pdf)
  - [TEX](papers/DimVeb/main.tex)
  - [BIB](papers/DimVeb/main.bib)

  <div class="collapse" id="collapseAbstract1">

  <div class="card card-body">
    This paper serves to define an extension, which we call dimensional Veblen, of Oswald Veblen's system of ordinal functions below the large Veblen ordinal. This is facilitated by iterating derivatives of ordinal functions along multidimensional array structures, and can be viewed as the "maximal" natural extension of the Veblen functions. We then construct an ordinal notation based on it, and provide a conversion algorithm from Buchholz's function below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal.

  <div class="collapse" id="collapseAbstract2">

  <div class="card card-body">
    We share both recent and older, well-known results regarding the notions of stable ordinals and shrewd cardinals. We then argue that nonprojectible ordinals may be considered as recursive analogues to subtle cardinals, a highly combinatorial type of cardinal related to Jensen's fine structure, due to the latter possessing a characterisation in terms of shrewdnesss.
  </div>
  </div>

  - ArXiV identifier: 2312.15818.

I have not published any sets of notes regarding courses or particular topics.

## In preparation

I'm preparing a couple of research articles and preprints, as well as a book or two teaching set theory and "pure apeirology" to beginners. Of course, I won't upload their PDF or TEX here yet, for reasons related to privacy and plagiarism.

# Programming

My languages of choice are Python, C++ and JavaScript. I also used to know C# and Go.

For very low-level things, x64 assembly is my main tool, despite all of its flaws. I'm currently developing a RISC alternative to it.

# Tarballs

Below are `.tar.gz` archives, for projects containing multiple files and a lot of data or code, created through `tar -zcvf`. I've also attached SHA-256 sums, to ensure you're not downloading a corrupt PDF.

- A tarball of the Dimensional Veblen PDF, bibliography and source code: [dimveb.tar.gz](tarballs/dimveb.tar.gz) ([sha256](sha256sums/dimveb.tar.gz.sha256)).
- A tarball of the recursive analogues PDF, bibliography and source code: [recanalogue.tar.gz](tarballs/recanalogue.tar.gz) ([sha256](sha256sums/recanalogue.tar.gz.sha256)).

# Contact

You can reach me by email at sylvie at 83c dot nl. It's a redirect to my main email, which I'm probably not going to put online. I might just set up my own SMTP server at some point.

In case you ever want to ensure nobody pries upon what you send to me or that I am really who I say I am, my public RSA key, in the OpenSSH format, is:

```

This has SHA-256 fingerprint `68:b7:d5:a7:57:23:40:c8:c3:3d:3e:81:65:40:df:f2:e1:26:8f:f4:0a:f5:cd:97:62:80:de:2d:29:e9:1c:84`.

For example, encrypting "Hello, World!", without any padding, should produce

```

should check out as validly signed (with BLAKE2b hash and PKCS #1 padding). These RSA standards are a mess to work out! So it might not work for you. I know this is all probably excessive.
