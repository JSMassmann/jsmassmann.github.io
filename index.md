# Hiii!

I'm a trans girl. My interests include:

- Maths, particularly computability theory, cryptography, set theory, model theory and proof theory.
- Programming. I know Python, JavaScript, C++, C# and Go. I have also dabbled in x86 NASM.
- All other sciences, but I don't know them at such a high level as I do maths and CS.
- The great video game Celeste.
- Listening to music. I have extremely eclectic tastes, recently I've really liked the "Hamilton" soundtrack.

# Other somewhat extraneous facts

My pronouns are she/her - but feel free to use they/them or neopronouns. As you could guess, I’m a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

I live in the UK and speak English fluently, and I used to speak German natively. My Myers-Briggs personality type is INTP-T.

You can reach me by email at sylvie@83c.nl.

# Academia-related

Here's where I'll put a repository of all my papers, slides, etc. related to my formal academic pursuit of mathematics.

My ORCID is 0009-0003-8458-4700.
My Erdős number is <code>NaN</code>.
I'm the author of OEIS sequence A368423.

## My research interests

This is basically my previous list of interests, but more specific (and it relates to things I actually do rather than, say, just reading).

- Proof theory, especially ordinal analysis and ordinal notations.
- Large cardinals and strong axioms of infinity.
- Constructibility, fine structure and inner model theory.
- Category theory and abstract algebra.
- Recursion theory, and its infinitary generalizations.
- Infinite game theory.
- Cryptography and cryptanalysis.

I am currently learning about determinacy, descriptive set theory, saturated ideals, and their connections to inner models with large cardinals. I also want to understand fine structure theory for inner models, and forcing (especially forcing axioms, generic ultrapowers and set-theoretic geology) at a much higher level than I do currently - right now I'm enthusiastic but don't know much beyond the basics.

I know some basic abstract algebra and algebraic number theory, and I intend to diversify my areas of interest from set theory to other areas of maths and physics, such as the aforementioned two areas.

## My research papers

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## My preprints and notes

I have so far published 2 preprints. I shall keep a repository of all my papers, as well as their LaTeX source code, on this website. I'm quite pedantic and consistent in spacing, etc. in LaTeX.

- "Extending the Veblen Function" w/ A. Kwon
  - [PDF](papers/DimVeb/Dimensional_Veblen.pdf)
  - [TEX](papers/DimVeb/main.tex)
  - [BIB](papers/DimVeb/main.bib)
  - <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseAbstract1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseAbstract1">Abstract</a>

  <div class="collapse" id="collapseAbstract1">

  <div class="card card-body">
    This paper serves to define an extension, which we call dimensional Veblen, of Oswald Veblen's system of ordinal functions below the large Veblen ordinal. This is facilitated by iterating derivatives of ordinal functions along multidimensional array structures, and can be viewed as the "maximal" natural extension of the Veblen functions. We then construct an ordinal notation based on it, and provide a conversion algorithm from Buchholz's function below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal.

- "Recursive Analogues of Shrewdness and Subtlety, with Applications to Fine Structure"
  - [PDF](papers/RecAnalogue/Recursive_Analogues_of_Shrewdness_and_Subtlety__with_Applications_to_Fine_Structure.pdf)

  - [BIB](papers/RecAnalogue/main.bib)
  - <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseAbstract2" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseAbstract2">Abstract</a>

  <div class="collapse" id="collapseAbstract2">

  <div class="card card-body">
    We share both recent and older, well-known results regarding the notions of stable ordinals and shrewd cardinals. We then argue that nonprojectible ordinals may be considered as recursive analogues to subtle cardinals, a highly combinatorial type of cardinal related to Jensen's fine structure, due to the latter possessing a characterisation in terms of shrewdnesss.

  - ArXiV identifier: 2312.15818.

I have not published any sets of notes regarding courses or particular topics.

## In preparation

I'm preparing a couple of research articles and preprints, as well as a book or two teaching set theory and "pure apeirology" to beginners. Of course, I won't upload their PDF or TEX here yet, for reasons related to privacy and plagiarism.

## My talks

I have not yet been invited to present any talks.

I have prepared slides, in the event I do ever present talks, regarding some papers. They may be easier to understand than those papers, which is one of the main reasons I'm uploading them here.

- "Ordinal Notations up to $$\eta_0$$", describing results of "Extending the Veblen Function".
  - [PDF](slides/DimVeb/Slides.pdf)
  - [Shortened PDF](slides/DimVeb/Slides%20(1).pdf)
  - [TEX](slides/DimVeb/main.tex)

Once again, all slides shall be uploaded. I also uploaded shortened versions, which omit pauses.

## My books

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## My manuscripts and monographs

Maybe there'll be something here one day.

## Service activities

Maybe there'll be something here one day.
